# Welcome to arne fork of openpilot

This README describes the custom features build by me (Arne Schwarck) on top of [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) of [comma.ai](http://comma.ai). This fork is optimized for the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid 2016 and for driving in Germany but also works with other cars and in other countries 
- [ ] TODO describe which other cars and countries are known

# Installation
## Panda flashing

To get this branch to work, it is required to flash your Panda because:
- changing acceleration limits and 
- adapting lane departure warning where it gives you a slight push back into the middle of the lane without needing to be engaged
- The Panda version is also changed and checked.

More info about Panda flashing can be found [here](https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Panda_Flashing).

## Installating this fork

More info about how to install this fork can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jfrux/comma-eon-installing-a-fork-of-openpilot-5c2b5c134b4b).

## Branches

- `release3`: this is the default branch that is most up to date with the openpilot 0.6 release branch. Normally you should use this branch.
- `066-clean`: this is my default branch. When I finishing this, I'll merge this into the `release2` branch.
- `release2`: this is my old branch, that is compatible with openpilot 0.5.

# Configuration

- [ ] TODO describe how to change/add custom setting in json file

# Todo

- [ ] Auto Lane change from Boggyver

- [ ] Traffic light detection from Littlemountainman

# Features

- Braking: 
    - by angle(carstate), 
    - by predicted angle in 2.5s(laneplanner), 
    - by model(commaai), 
    - acceleration measured by steering angle, 
    - by curvature (mapd), 
    - by mapped sign(stop, yield, roundabouts, bump, hump, traffic light, speed sign, road attribute)
- No disengage for gas, only longitudinal disengage for brake, tire slip or cancel
- Only disengage on main off and on brake at low speed
- Reacting Toyota tssp higher acceleration and braking limits.
- Speed sign reading 
- Phantom: control open pilot via app like summon
- Stock Toyota ldw steering assist
- Control 3 gas profiles with sport eco and normal buttons on car
- Dynamic gas and distance profiles
- Cruise set speed available down to 7 kph
- Lane hugging fixes
- Smooth longitudinal controller also at low speeds
- No disengage for seat belt remove and door opened. Practical for when stopping and then someone opens a door so that the car does not drive into the lead
- No fingerprint compatibility problems. A completely different way to combine and split Fingerprints so that they always work I.e. comma is not supporting rav4h 2019 because of this Fingerprint method. Mine is better
- Custom events and capnp structure so that comma is happy with the drives from my fork
- Forward collision warning actually brakes for you.
